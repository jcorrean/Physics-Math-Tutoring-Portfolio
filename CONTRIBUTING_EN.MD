## My Experience

When my daughter was struggling with AP Physics, I searched for months for a tutor who could help her truly understand, not just memorize formulas. Dr. Caicedo was exactly what we needed.

What impressed me most was his ability to explain complex concepts in multiple ways until it clicked. He never made my daughter feel bad for not understanding something immediately. Instead, he'd say "Let me show you another way to think about this" and come at it from a completely different angle.

His "Street Fighter vs Good Boy" method was a game-changer. My daughter could see both the intuitive understanding AND the rigorous mathematical proof, which helped her on both conceptual questions and calculation problems.

## What I Appreciate Most

Dr. Caicedo genuinely cares about his students understanding the material, not just passing tests. My daughter went from dreading physics to actually enjoying it and asking questions out of curiosity rather than obligation.

Also, his patience is extraordinary. He never rushes, never makes anyone feel silly for asking questions, and celebrates every "aha!" moment like it's a major victory.
